# SecretAgentsMessagingSystem
## Project Overview
This project implements a secure client-server messaging system in Java, designed to allow secret agents to communicate securely. The system utilizes RSA encryption for message confidentiality and authentication, ensuring that messages are only readable by the intended recipients and verifiably sent from legitimate agents.

## Features
- **Client-Server Architecture:** Utilizes a robust client-server model for message handling and delivery.
- **RSA Encryption:** Employs RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding for secure message encryption and decryption.
- **Digital Signatures:** Incorporates SHA256withRSA for message authentication and integrity verification.
- **Anonymity and Security:** Ensures agent anonymity and secure message storage through encrypted recipient IDs and server-side message encryption.
